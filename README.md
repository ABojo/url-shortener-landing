# URL Shortener Landing page

This is a URL Shortener landing page built with Vue and SCSS. The page is mostly static so I decided to drop the Vue script right onto the page rather than using build tools.

## Features

- Communicates with shrtco.de API to generate short URLs
- Stores short URLs in local storage
- Clipboarding
- Mobile and desktop navigation
- Responsive design
